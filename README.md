## ⛔️ DEPRECATED

This repository is deprecated and will no longer be actively maintained by myself.<br>
If you want to continue to use an ANT+ library for Javascript/Typescript, please migrate to [incyclist-ant-plus](https://github.com/incyclist/ant-plus) - which is the repository I will continue to maintain, or use any other fork of [Loghorn's ant-plus](https://github.com/Loghorn/ant-plus) 

[incyclist-ant-plus](https://github.com/incyclist/ant-plus) has the following benefits:
- much cleaner interface
- supports sending commands to the sensors (e.g. ANT+ FE)
- can support multiple bindings ( e.g. ANT DLL, IPC, ..)

But it also has drawbacks:
- Less supported profiles ( I only copied the profiles, I'm using in the [Incyclist](https://incyclist.com) indoor cycling app
- documentation not yet completed
